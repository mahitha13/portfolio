									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>Ever since I was a small child I have been interested in design. I picked up art at a very young age and even took drawing and painting lessons for over a year. Gradually as I grew up and got busy with my studies I lost touch with the creative side of me. I began taking interest in computers and ultimately pursued my formal college education in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. I was reunited with my love for design through my undergraduate studies when I took up Animation and Graphics in my 3rd semester. Finally, I was introduced to HCI in my final semester when I took up the course Designing Human Centered Systems at IIIT Delhi. I am forever grateful to my university and professors who introduced me to the field which allows me to explore my creativity and passion for computer interfaces.</p>
									<p>My motivation to design not just as a hobby but serve a greater purpose in making people's life easier came from this course. To build my knowledge and be more informed about the field I decided to pursue my Master's in HCI from University of Maryland. I have never been more happier with a decision, as I have learnt a lot in my first semester here and have been thoroughly happy despite a busy schedule. My ideologies regarding the field have been shattered and reinvented and I am excited to learn more in the semesters to come. Till then I hope I get the oppurtunity to serve people's needs to the best of my knowledge and design solutions that are both visually pleasing and usable. </p>
