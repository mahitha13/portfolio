                                <h2>The Client</h2>
								<p>Our client was Visit Harford! Inc, the Destination Marketing Organization for Harford County, Maryland. Harford is a county located just 25 miles northeast of Baltimore and along the shores of Chesapaeke Bay. The county's website(<a href="https://visitharford.com" target="_blank">visitharford.com</a>) and mobile apps aim at promoting the county's attractions to bring in tourism. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Research Goal</h2>
								<p>The client’s goal is to identify the shortcomings of Visit Harford website and app and hence improve the user experience to ultimately bring in more tourism to the county and increase revenue and support for local businesses. The aim of the research is as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>to expand the reach of the website beyond 30-40 year-olds</li>
                                    <li>to lay more emphasis on engaging business and vacationing visitors</li>
                                    <li>to identify wants of visitors and translate it into features and offerings by the county</li>
                                </ul>  

								<h2>The Process</h2>
								<p>
                                </p>
                                
                                <h2>Data Collection</h2>
								<p>The main research method for our project was <b>contextual inquiry</b>. We wanted a broad sense of users' preferences and patterns while planning a trip within their natural context. Contextual inquiries are a rich source of such qualitative data.
                                <br>    
                                For the scope of our project we decided to take a focused approach and narrow our target audience to people in their 20s. We interviewed 8 people from different backgrounds based on their occupation and relationship status to see how these variations factor into their planning habits and ultimately how the county website fits into their planning process.</p>
                                <h4>Interview Focus</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>User’s Intention of using the app/website</li>
                                    <li>Understand what information users are looking for</li>
                                    <li>The features of the app/website users interact with to find out about the county’s offerings</li>
                                    <li>The steps users take while navigating through the website and apps</li>
                                    <li>Other resources/apps/websites users use along with the county’s website to inform their decisions</li>
                                    <li>Preconceived notions the user might have about Harford County</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h2>Data Interpretation</h2>
                                <p>
                                    After every two interviews we conducted interpretation sessions to come up with data models and interview/affinity notes reflective of the user interview. The models we chose were traditional contextual design models - <b>Identity Model and Sequence Model</b>. The identity model gives insights about broad user personalities that emerge from the users' planning process whereas the sequence model captures the steps users take while planning along with the issues they face during navigation. After 
                                    We conducted four sessions in total where every team member played his or her role as either one of theses - Note Taker, Identity Modeler, Sequence Modeler and Interviewer. After generating eight models (four identity and four sequence), we consolidated these to get one identity and one sequence model for all the users/interviews combined. This gives a broad overview of the users behaviours and navigational patterns.</p>

                                    Apart from the data modelling, we did affinity mapping to see the themes that emerge in the users' behaviours regarding the website and planning process.

                                <p> Once we finished building the affinity maps and consolidating the models, we did a wall walk to generate design ideas from the refined user data. We came up with a list of issues and some hot ideas to tackle these issues by brainstorming in a round robin fashion within the team. The top voted ideas were then pursued further to create vision boards to generate solutions for the user issues and ultimately generate product concepts.
    
                                </p>

                                <p>Some of the top ideas that we came up with were the <b>Personalized Trip Ideas</b> and <b>Trip Planner</b>. We decided to pursue these further in our visioning sessions.</p>

									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>Ever since I was a small child I have been interested in design. I picked up art at a very young age and even took drawing and painting lessons for over a year. Gradually as I grew up and got busy with my studies I lost touch with the creative side of me. I began taking interest in computers and ultimately pursued my formal college education in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. I was reunited with my love for design through my undergraduate studies when I took up Animation and Graphics in my 3rd semester. Finally, I was introduced to HCI in my final semester when I took up the course Designing Human Centered Systems at IIIT Delhi. I am forever grateful to my university and professors who introduced me to the field which allows me to explore my creativity and passion for computer interfaces.</p>
									<p>My motivation to design not just as a hobby but serve a greater purpose in making people's life easier came from this course. To build my knowledge and be more informed about the field I decided to pursue my Master's in HCI from University of Maryland. I have never been more happier with a decision, as I have learnt a lot in my first semester here and have been thoroughly happy despite a busy schedule. My ideologies regarding the field have been shattered and reinvented and I am excited to learn more in the semesters to come. Till then I hope I get the oppurtunity to serve people's needs to the best of my knowledge and design solutions that are both visually pleasing and usable. </p>
