                                <h2>The Idea</h2>
								<p><a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/">IIIT Delhi</a> is a research institute located in Okhla, New Delhi that was founded in 2008 and is growing rapidly each year. There are currently about 3000 students enrolled into the institute across all disciplines and degrees. The institute has a website(<a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/">iiitd.ac.in</a>) that is useful for people to gather general information about the institute. But there is no useful features or information for the current students enrolled in the institute. 
                                Our idea was to address and derive solutions for the students' needs and incorporate them at one common place. We decided to create a mobile app as it will be useful for students on the go. Hence we came up with the idea of IIITD Mobile - A mobile app for the institute's students.
                                </p>
                                
								<h2>The Process</h2>
                                <section class="columns double">
									<div class="column">
										
										<p>
											We decided to use the iterative design process for this project. We first gathered user requirements through user interviews and analysed them before ideating and designing to keep in mind the user's preferences. Further, we created multiple iterations of low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes and conducted user testing interviews after each iteration to identify discrepancies in the design and user need. After finalizing the high fidelity we developed an early stage android app on android studio.

                                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
								<p>We initially collected user requirements through user interviews with several students from different backgrounds. The method of recruitment was posting flyers to call in volunteers and guerilla interviews. During the interview we asked the user about what information and features he seeks from the university website or university in general that they would like to access on mobile. We also asked them their preferences in customizability and design of the app. After noting down the requirements generated out of the interviews we sorted them into a feature map. Using this feature map we identified key points that we were going to address in our design.</p>
                                <br>
                                
                                <h2>Low Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
                                <p>
                                   After filtering out key requirements from the feature map we began brainstorming solutions and design ideas for the app. After creating rough sketches of individual feature we came up with the first round of low fidelity prototypes. After which we conducted user testing where we used observation and think-aloud method to identify user's concerns and pains. This way we conducted two more iterations of design and testing to finally arrive at the final low fidelity prototype.</p>

									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>Ever since I was a small child I have been interested in design. I picked up art at a very young age and even took drawing and painting lessons for over a year. Gradually as I grew up and got busy with my studies I lost touch with the creative side of me. I began taking interest in computers and ultimately pursued my formal college education in Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree. I was reunited with my love for design through my undergraduate studies when I took up Animation and Graphics in my 3rd semester. Finally, I was introduced to HCI in my final semester when I took up the course Designing Human Centered Systems at IIIT Delhi. I am forever grateful to my university and professors who introduced me to the field which allows me to explore my creativity and passion for computer interfaces.</p>
									<p>My motivation to design not just as a hobby but serve a greater purpose in making people's life easier came from this course. To build my knowledge and be more informed about the field I decided to pursue my Master's in HCI from University of Maryland. I have never been more happier with a decision, as I have learnt a lot in my first semester here and have been thoroughly happy despite a busy schedule. My ideologies regarding the field have been shattered and reinvented and I am excited to learn more in the semesters to come. Till then I hope I get the oppurtunity to serve people's needs to the best of my knowledge and design solutions that are both visually pleasing and usable. </p>
